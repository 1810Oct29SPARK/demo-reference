            <p style="color:blue">This is unplanned it really just happens. With practice comes confidence. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. You have to make those little noises or it won't work.
                If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You can get away with a lot. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.
                And maybe a little bush lives there. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. Use your imagination, let it go. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.

            <p>That easy. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. You can create anything that makes you happy.  
                Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.
                We'll put a happy little sky in here. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. In your world you can create anything you desire. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. This piece of canvas is your world. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.
                We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Don't fiddle with it all day. We'll play with clouds today.
